> Languages: Python-Pyqt5-Tensorflow
> Remark
* Enter the folder name (Test)
* click show for displaying the letters
* click predict button for prediction
* You can create new folder with create button and upload photos of arabic letters then predict the letters
* You need ot download the model first for prediction
